Qs.B) The source of the data set used in my programm is the IRIS Flower dataset from Keggle.com.
      The link for the source is as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/code/sukhadadharangaonkar/iris-flower-decision-tree-classifier/data
      
Qs.C) In this program I used the scikitlearn library with the Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm. I chose it as it is simple to understand and to interpret.           Also the trees can be visualized. Decision Tree Algorithm requires little data preparation and is able to handle both numerical and categorical data. One       can easily handle multiple outputs of the program and we can also validate a model using statistical tests.
